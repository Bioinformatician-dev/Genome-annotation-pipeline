# Genome-annotation-pipeline
The goal of this project is to create a genome annotation pipeline that processes raw genomic data and annotates it using established tools such as Prokka or Maker. The pipeline should be automated to streamline the workflow and provide a user-friendly interface for users to easily input their data and receive annotated results.
